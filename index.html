                  Here I will focus on the Kipsigis custom; <strong>marriage.</strong>
                      <br>Traditionally, <em>marriage</em> is an important custom in Kipsigis society. 
                          It involves some stages that one (men) have to follow so as to show that he is ready to start a family.
                          These include identifying the lady, approaching the parents or the elders, the two families meeting and the 
                          day of the ceremony being planned.

            <p>There are other things related to marriage in the kipsigis culture. These include the following;</p>
                     <ul>
                      <li><b>Exogamy</b></li>
                      <p>Marriage is strictly exogamous, whereby no male may marry a woman of his clan or oret. Descendants of a woman may marry after the third generation.
                           Exogamy extends to the family of the man and woman assigned to care for teenage initiates (boys and girls).
                           It also extends through generations. One may not marry the children of a man of the same generation.</p>
                           <li><b>Polygamy and other marriage states</b></li>
                           <p>Polygamy is practiced with certain restrictions. A widow may become the partner of her husband's brother but with consent of the ageset. 
                               A childless elderly widow may 'wed' a young woman for support.</p>
